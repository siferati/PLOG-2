/**
* Implementation was heavily inspired from
* 'Teaching Constraints through Logic Puzzles' by PÃ©ter Szeredi,
* Dept. of Computer Science and Information Theory,
* Budapest University of Technology and Economics
* (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.97.9715&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
*
* The main loop is implemented here.
* All dependencies are also declared here,
* so other files don't include any.
*
* This implementation follows 'the border model',
* which is explained in the article mentioned above.
